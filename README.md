Our app, Guardians, will immediately message your emergency contacts or loved ones such that if there was ever an accident, they can make sure that you are ok and if no one is able to respond or call you and you don't use the app, it will call 911.

How it works is by using the accelerometer from the phone, we can detect rapid decrease in speed and acceleration such that if there was ever a decrease, we can message their emergency contacts immediately and if there is no response from either the user or the emergency contact, it will call the police.

By doing this, we can hopefully increase value in downloading messenger as we can reduce the average response time for potential injury or fatal crashes and get people the fast responses that they need which can have an immediate global impact.
